Brambles Deli Café needed to create a new website that incorporated numerous essential elements, including featuring online forms, photography, and pages of information. It was a complicated.</p>

<p> We needed to feel complete and total confidence in the abilities of the web developer that would take this on. This is where Media Studio came in. We met with numerous web development groups, but did not feel the synergy or trust required until with met with Media Studio.</p>

<p> They helped provide professional expertise in clear language. Their knowledge and confidence from other projects provided us the perspective and efficiency we needed to take as much pain out of the process as possible. Timelines were met, even when we didn't think possible.</p>

<p> Now that all is said and done, and we are in a maintenance stage, we have received top notch assistance when changes and tweaks were needed. When we need to call with advice, our questions are answered immediately. We are extremely pleased we chose Media Studio and would not hesitate to recommend them to others.<img src="images/comma_rev.jpg" alt="comma" width="20" height="20" align="absmiddle"></p>

Shane Walsh has prepared and upgraded my websites over the past number of years.  Each time he makes improvements that enhance the visual appeal of my website and puts me higher up the search engine.  </p>
<p>As a result of Shane's expertise in terms of content, visuals, optimization, etc. my advertising costs have been dramatically reduced.  I am delighted to say that the newly improved website has generated considerable new business.
  
  Shane is a pleasure to deal with.  He is efficient, professional and highly competent.  I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Shane to colleagues, clients and friends. <img src="images/comma_rev.jpg" alt="comma" width="20" height="20" align="absmiddle"></p>

<p><img src="images/comma.jpg" alt="comma" width="20" height="20">MediaStudio redesigned a website for Hynes Agency in 2010. This was a difficult task as this business had been established in 1937   we wished to portray our heritage and traditional values whilst   portraying our dynamic contemporary practice.</p>
<p>I was so pleased with the website they produced that I immediately   requested that they also design new sites for my other 2 businesses.
  PA Career Consultancy - www.abettercv.ie and www.holidayapartments.ie</p>
<p>Over the years Shane has consistently upgraded our sites , thus   maintaining a professional image we are proud of. On the odd occasion   when we encountered a problem Shane always reacted promptly and resolved   the issues to our complete satisfaction.</p>
<p>I have recommended MediaStudio to colleagues and friends who I am   pleased to say are equally impressed by their diligence, excellent   designs and never failing courtesy. I look forward to an ongoing mutually beneficial professional relationship.<img src="images/comma_rev.jpg" alt="comma" width="20" height="20" align="absmiddle"></p>
